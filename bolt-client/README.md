This crate contains an asynchronous tokio-based client for servers implementing the 
[Bolt v1](https://boltprotocol.org/v1/) protocol.

The main feature of this library is the [`Client`](https://docs.rs/bolt-client/*/bolt_client/struct.Client.html) 
struct, which provides methods that correspond to Bolt messages that may be sent to a compatible server.

See the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/bolt-client) for more details and examples.
