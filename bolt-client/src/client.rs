    /// If authentication fails, the server will respond with a [`FAILURE`](Message::Failure)
    /// message and immediately close the connection. Clients wishing to retry initialization
    /// should establish a new connection.

    /// - `scheme` is the authentication scheme. Predefined schemes are `"none"`, `"basic"`, or
    ///   `"kerberos"`.
    ///
    /// If using Bolt v4.1 or later, the following additional `metadata` entries can be specified:
    /// - `routing`, a map which should contain routing context information as well as an `address`
    ///   field indicating to which address the client should initially connect. Leaving this
    ///   unspecified indicates that the server should not carry out any routing.
    ///   _(Bolt v4.1+ only.)_

    ///   - `connection_id`, a unique identifier for the connection (e.g. `"bolt-61"`)

    ///     to augment operations where applicable. Hints remain valid throughout the lifetime of a
